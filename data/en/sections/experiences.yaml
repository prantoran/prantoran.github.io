    responsibilities:
    - As a core member of Application AutoScaling, I have gained extensive knowledge in service-oriented architectures and cloud infrastructures. 
    - Autoscaling is an important feature for reducing costs and I have worked on integrating auto scaling with popular AWS products such as EC2, DynamoDB, Lambda, CloudWatch, CloudFormation, CDK, SageMaker, ECS, EMR and ElasticCache during expansion to new regions.
    - I have owned projects end to end by making design plans reviewed by my team, task breakdown, security approvals, implementing the updates, deploying world wide, and implementing validation and load tests.
    - Designed and implemented an improved throttling process by setting up rules for groups that accounts can join to get higher throttling rates. The upgrade expedited new region builds by one week as other teams can independently join groups with higher limits without requiring manual update from our team.
    - Collaborated on enabling custom math expressions that combine more than one metrics for setting up auto scaling configurations.
    - I am experienced in operations as I have on-call experience tackling multiple critical team-wide and a number of organization wide severities.
